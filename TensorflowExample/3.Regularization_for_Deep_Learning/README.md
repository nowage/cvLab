# pyowl: Ordered Weighted L1 Regularization in Python

![OWL vs Lasso example](toy_example.png?raw=true "OWL vs Lasso example")

The OWL norm generalizes L1, L_inf and OSCAR. In particular, OSCAR selects
coefficients in groups with equal values, therefore handling highly
correlated features in a robust way.

Also known as Sorted L1 norm or SLOPE.

This implementation manages to be very short thanks to the awesome scientific
python ecosystem.
